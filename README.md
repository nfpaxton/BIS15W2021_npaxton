## About me:
Hey there! I am a senior studying Plant Biology, and I like to explore the plant kingdom through the lenses of ecology, evolution, and ethnobotany. In my free time I enjoy reading, listening to podcasts, and rock climbing. I'm taking this class to become a better, more skilled scientist and because Dr. Ledford is the only professor who I, as a not-so-computer-savvy 22 year old, trust will make learning to program a thoroughly enjoyable experience.
